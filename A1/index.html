                <h1>Customer Reviews</h1>
                <h3>Lilly James</h3>
                <p>I love my pearl necklace from Grace. The pearls are genuine and shiny, the clasp is sturdy, and the packaging was 
                    beautiful. The customer service was also excellent. They answered my questions, gave me a discount code, and thanked 
                    me for my purchase. Grace is graceful in everything they do, from their products to their service. I highly recommend 
                    them to anyone who wants elegant and unique accessories.</p>
                <h3>Ruby Jackson</h3>
                <p>The bracelet from Grace was okay, but not what I expected. The size, color, and packaging were different from the website. 
                    The customer service was polite, but not helpful. Grace is average, not graceful. I might buy from them again, but only 
                    with a coupon.</p>
